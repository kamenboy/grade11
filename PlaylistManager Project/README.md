# PlaylistManager™

**PlaylistManager™** is a Java-based desktop application built with Swing GUI that allows the users to manage their own music playlists - they are allowed to add songs, remove them, sort by title or duration, save/delete multiple playlists from files. The playlists are saved as .txt files in the data/ directory. The GUI Window has a menu bar for creating/opening/saving playlists. A central list showing songs. Buttons to add/remove/sort songs. There is a pop-up window for song input and a new playlist.

**File Structure:**

Download the ZiP folder as it is in GitHub. There should be 2 folders and 2 files (README.md & UML Diagram.png). The first folder is src, where in the directory /src you should have 4 files - MainApp.java, Song.java, Playlist.java, MediaItem.java. The second folder is labeled data, where the playlists would be stored

**How to Run:**

Compile all Java files (type the command in the terminal):

`javac MainApp.java Playlist.java Song.java`

Run the application:

`java MainApp`
